This is an elevator I coded in 2020. Admittedly, there is a considerable amount of progress I had made since my 2017 elevator 
as well as my 2019 version. The biggest improvement was the use of tweening. Tweening allows for better dyanmic, more realistic
movement. Tweening also is easier to manage and control. For example, instead of having a loop to move the elevator it can be 
done in a single line. In addition, the time the tween will take to execute will be precise. This is why tweening is beneficial.

The second aspect of improvements would be in regards to improvements in coding practices. For example, I used a module script
for welding the elevator together. Module scripts allow for global functions of sorts. Scripts can access functions in a module.
This makes modules useful if you use repeatable code across a wide variety of scripts. 

However, given the improvements I did make, with hindishgt I recognize the shortcomings of this code. Most notably,
